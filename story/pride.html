The visitor in white leaves in silence,<br>
while the visitor in red grins at you.<br>
They begin to explain that you could only<br>
choose one of the choices.<br>
You say, yes... I knew that.<br>
But they say that you didn't.
<br>								
The visitor in red explains that the one you did<br>
not choose, you will lose forever<br>
because choices have consequences.
<br>						
So now you have to live your life with <br>
endless pride, but now you're missing perfection...<br>
Which means there's flaws.<br>
Now there's not anything wrong with flaws...<br>
Unless they hold you back on improvement.
<br>				
Nothing you do will never be perfect.<br>
Which is fine, perfection cannot be reached...<br>
but the issue is that you now have nothing to strive for.<br>
You're too prideful in things that aren't up to par, but you<br>
refuse to take advice or critique to improve.<br>
You begin to realize that pride is nothing without perfection.<br>
