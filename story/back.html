You head back home, get out of your car and head back inside.<br>
You grab your blanket and go to sit down to watch a movie.
<br>	
<br>	
The doorbell rings so you go to get it.<br>
A package is delivered to you, it's the mug you ordered.<br>
You're so happy it arrived so soon since<br> 
your other one broke a few days ago.
<br>	
<br>	
You sit down and watch a movie, wrapped in your<br>
 blanket with a cup of hot chocolate.<br>
You think, well... It was a normal day, at least you<br>
went out for a bit, and you're pretty satisfied with that.
