You say thank you but no.<br>
You tell them that you don't like accepting things...<br>
That it makes you feel vunerable, selfish, or makes <br>
you feel obligated to give back, even if you can't.
<br>	
<br>	
They smile and say that feeling vulnerable makes<br>
us human, that even accepting a compliment is still a gift.<br>
It's not selfish as long as you appreciate it.<br>
And that giving back doesn't always have to be in<br>
the same way you received.
<br>		
<br>				
They tell you to enjoy the weather, because at least the rain<br>
brings out a rainbow.
