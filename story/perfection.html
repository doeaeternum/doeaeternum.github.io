The visitor in white leaves in silence,<br>
while the visitor in red grins at you.<br>
They begin to explain that you could only<br>
choose one of the choices.<br>
You say, yes... I knew that.<br>
But they say that you didn't.
<br>								
The visitor in red explains that the one you did<br>
not choose, you will lose forever<br>
because choices have consequences.
<br>					
So now everything you do<br>
is perfection, but all of your pride has vanished.<br>
Well, isn't being prideful a deadly sin?<br>
Good riddence, you say.<br>
But is that really the case?
<br>					
Without pride you cannot seem to find satisfaction<br>	
in anything you do, there is no sense of being proud <br>	
of yourself or worthy of anything.<br>	
You begin to realize that perfection is worthless<br>	 
unless you have pride,<br>
as long as you don't let your pride consume you.<br>
