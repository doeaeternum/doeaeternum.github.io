You go out to your car and start to drive.<br>
Thoughts of life and all those things start filling your head.<br>
<br>					
<br>					
Before you know it a bit of time has passed,<br>
about an hour,<br>
and you're starting to get bored of driving. 
<br>					
<br>				
You try to decide if you want to...<br>
<a href="back.html">go back home</a> or to <a href="driving.html">keep driving</a>
