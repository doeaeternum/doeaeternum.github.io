You hear a knock on your door, so you go to open it<br>
At the door you see the two visitors scowling at each other.<br>
They realize you're standing there and quickly change their expressions.<br>
The visitors introduce themselves with a name<br>
in a language that you do not understand.<br>
Each say they have choices for you.
<br>
The one visitor<br>
who is dressed in red<br>
offers up choices that grant you<br>
<a href="perfection.html">perfection</a> or <a href="pride.html">pride</a>
<br>
The other visitor<br>
who is dressed in white<br>
offers up choices that grant you<br>
<a href="happiness.html">happiness</a> or a <a href="peace_of_mind.html">peace of mind</a>
