The visitor in red leaves in bitterness,<br>
mumbling beneath their breath.<br>
The visitor in white happily thanks you for choosing them.<br>
They begin to explain that you could only<br>
choose one of the choices.<br>
You say, yes... I knew that.<br>
But they say that you didn't.
<br>				
The visitor in white explains that the one you did<br>
not choose, you will lose forever<br>
because choices have consequences.
<br>				
You can't go wrong with endless happiness, right?<br>
ENDLESS HAPPINESS!!!! That sounds amazing...
<br>				
No, sorry it can't be amazing because without a peace<br>
of mind, you will never truly know if things are okay since <br>
you still doubt and struggle over things.<br>
Even though you're happy, you'll never be able to<br>
accept things or be able<br>
to reassure yourself.
