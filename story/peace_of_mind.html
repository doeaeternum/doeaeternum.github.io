The visitor in red leaves in bitterness,<br>
mumbling beneath their breath.<br>
The visitor in white happily thanks you for choosing them.<br>
They begin to explain that you could only<br>
choose one of the choices.<br>
You say, yes... I knew that.<br>
But they say that you didn't.
<br>				
The visitor in white explains that the one you did<br>
not choose, you will lose forever<br>
because choices have consequences.
<br>				
So now you have a peace of mind for the rest of your life.<br>
Well, you can't go wrong with peace in any shape or form... right?
<br>				
Peace of mind is great, but part of having it is that once<br>
achieved is being able to find happiness,<br>
and now you won't be able to find that.<br>
It is supposed to be part of the pursuit of happiness.<br>
You can be at a peace of mind and accept things,<br>
but what is it without happiness?
