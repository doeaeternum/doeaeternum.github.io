You tell them thank you and ask them to get<br>
into more detail about paying it forward that they spoke of.<br>
They say that they weren't having a good day<br>
So they decided to go out, despite the rain, and ended up<br>

They explain that they thanked you because of <br>

by not allowing the weather to dictate your day, and now<br>
they can trust that you'll pay it forward in favor of another.
